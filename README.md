Explorer Apps
====================================
There are four applications in this project, _KeywordExplorer_, _TweetsCountExplorer_, _TweetDownloader_, and _WikiPageviewExplorer_. A brief overview of each can be reached using the links below. 

[KeywordExplorer](./markup/KeywordExplorer.md) is a Python desktop app that lets you use the GPT-3 to search for keywords and Twitter to see if those keywords are any good.

[TweetDownloader](./markup/TweetDownloader.md)

[WikiPageviewExplorer](./markup/WikiPageviewExplorer.md)

## Before using!!
KeywordExplorer *requires* that you have an OpenAI account and a Twitter developer account.

OpenAI: https://openai.com/api/

Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en

In each case you'll have to get an ID and set it as an environment variable. The names must be OPENAI_KEY for your GPT-3 account and BEARER_TOKEN_2 for your Twitter account, as shown below for a Windows environment:
