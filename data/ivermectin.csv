@YCFlores @ThomasPrime62 @laurenboebert @Twitter @facebook @instagram If your ignorance is continuing to cloud your ability to see the truth so be it. Live with it. Ivermectin is a proven drug used for humans. Yes there is a version for deporting horses but it was discovered and purposed for humans. I'm sure even you can read supporting facts
"@_brandonbrown_ They said something about their ""algorithm""

I have STRs in Gainesville, FL - where there's two official ""pride months"" - set against a backdrop of Confederate flags and stores that sell Ivermectin in both horse and human sized servings.

@freedomrings22 @FKaiser765 @flameman97 @lorraine01640 HCQ showed no better than placebo in many controlled double blind studies.  Ivermectin was possibly a weak effect based on one small study.  They did find out it was better to put people prone than intubate after a while.

@erdocAA I wasn‚Äôt buying it 99+% recovery rate or experimental jab that they were giving everything cheeseburgers to lotto tickets to take the experiment. Family Dr confirmed HCQ and ivermectin works but can‚Äôt be prescribed for cv19 sounded like government scam.
@justachemist002 @FKaiser765 @flameman97 @lorraine01640 I believe that many were counted as ‚Äúwith Covid‚Äù not ‚Äúfrom Covid.‚Äù There was a financial incentive. Further they used drugs like REMDESIVIR or ventilated unnecessarily that killed people while denying access to effective treatments like ivermectin and HCQ. They wanted us scared.
"If you are not able or want to have ivermectin on hand for this coming fall, get the Novaxavid C-19 vaccine. It is highly effective against the new variants. Public Health agencies giving out vaccines don't share their data with each other. Get the safe non-mRNA Novaxavid vaccine"

@YCFlores @ThomasPrime62 @laurenboebert @Twitter @facebook @instagram If your ignorance is continuing to cloud your ability to see the truth so be it. Live with it. Ivermectin is a proven drug used for humans. Yes there is a version for deporting horses but it was discovered and purposed for humans. I'm sure even you can read supporting facts
"@_brandonbrown_ They said something about their ""algorithm""

I have STRs in Gainesville, FL - where there's two official ""pride months"" - set against a backdrop of Confederate flags and stores that sell Ivermectin in both horse and human sized servings.

@freedomrings22 @FKaiser765 @flameman97 @lorraine01640 HCQ showed no better than placebo in many controlled double blind studies.  Ivermectin was possibly a weak effect based on one small study.  They did find out it was better to put people prone than intubate after a while.

@erdocAA I wasn‚Äôt buying it 99+% recovery rate or experimental jab that they were giving everything cheeseburgers to lotto tickets to take the experiment. Family Dr confirmed HCQ and ivermectin works but can‚Äôt be prescribed for cv19 sounded like government scam.
@justachemist002 @FKaiser765 @flameman97 @lorraine01640 I believe that many were counted as ‚Äúwith Covid‚Äù not ‚Äúfrom Covid.‚Äù There was a financial incentive. Further they used drugs like REMDESIVIR or ventilated unnecessarily that killed people while denying access to effective treatments like ivermectin and HCQ. They wanted us scared.
"If you are not able or want to have ivermectin on hand for this coming fall, get the Novaxavid C-19 vaccine. It is highly effective against the new variants. Public Health agencies giving out vaccines don't share their data with each other. Get the safe non-mRNA Novaxavid vaccine"
